## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>=18.x)
- **Yarn** package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dashpets.git

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

### Running the Development Server
To start a local development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will run a Vite-powered development server for fast builds and hot module replacement.

### Building for Production
To create a production-ready build:
```bash
yarn build
```
This will:
1. Use TypeScript to type-check and transpile the source code.
2. Use Vite to bundle and optimize the assets for the `dist` folder.

The output will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
